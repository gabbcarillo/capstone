        "We bought this for our daughter because of four cats in her home.  It made quite a difference in the air quality in her house, especially since she has seasonal allergies.  It worked so well we bought another one for a different area of her house.  Filters are readily available on Amazon, and it is amazing to see the debris that is collected in these compact air purifiers.",
        "After 10 months we still haven�t had the signal to change the filter. I changed the filter and it was so easy, that I bought another Levoit with smart technology. Great product!",
        "Levoit Air PurifierGreadt product, looks good, and it does the job."
