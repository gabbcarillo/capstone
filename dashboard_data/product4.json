        "Used this every day since we got it! We have had to change the filter twice in maybe 2 years and we did have a dog. It worked great for a larger room like a living room or bigger bed room.",
        "Very quiet operation and is a quality air purifier. Changing the filter is easy with inexpensive replacements plentiful.",
        "This is truly an excellent device�for people with allergies and really for anyone. It cleans and purifies the air in your comfort zone. I highly recommend it; I use it daily, every night. Best wishes!"
