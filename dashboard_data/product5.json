        "I've had this air purifier for almost 5 years. It has worked great from day one. I've never had a problem with this unit, and it removes odors really well. I would highly recommend this product.",
        "I bought this months ago and waited to review it. I use it in the bedroom where I have a cat sleeping in that room and wanted to make sure the air quality was improved.  It is quiet and efficient and happy to have purchased it.  Can recommend that it is a good investment and I used it for a length of time with no problems."
