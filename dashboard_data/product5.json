        "A must have in the home. It's easy to clean and definitely works!",
        "I have 2 large dogs and bought these to help clear the air from their hair/dandruff. Plus I live on a dirt road and my house can get dusty real easily. It does really good and the fact that you can clean the filter is a huge bonus. I have one set up in my bedroom and one in my main living area but plan on purchasing another one for the main room due to the size.",
