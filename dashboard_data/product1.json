        "This air purifier unit has worked just great for years. I love that you can remotely control it. I like that you can set up a schedule and set quiet mode and see when you need to change filters and connect up to Alexa if necessary and turn on and off when you�re not at home great unit for the price recommend!",
        "This is an excellent product...just the right size, 3 speeds to choose from, very easy to use, and even looks great sitting where you place it. I loved it so much that I bought a second one for another room.",
        "Such a good product. I leave it near my cat's litter box and it prevents the smell pretty well."
