        "purchased for tenant who lives in my rental property, I was told the product works perfectly, and they were quite pleased with the air quality. Definitely a good choice for this purchase.",
        "This is an excellent product...just the right size, 3 speeds to choose from, very easy to use, and even looks great sitting where you place it. I loved it so much that I bought a second one for another room.",
        "Quiet, works well and perfect for an office setting. Easy to set up, the cord is a little short but great for on top of a desk"
