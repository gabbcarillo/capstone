        "Works great.  Still playing with the settings to fine tune how I want it to run for me.  Easy setup and easy to operate using the touch on the unit or the app.  Waiting to see how much of a difference it will make with the dust and cat hair.",
        "I could not breathe due to pet allergies before getting this. I absolutely love it!  Less dusting too!",
        "I love the Lovoit Air Purifier. It is very effective in removing dust and is very quiet."
