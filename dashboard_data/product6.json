        "Spring brings the dust, pollen, and mold. Basically the spring onslaught of seasonal allergies.  After a few days of headaches, I needed to get something.  Basic research quickly led me to this air purifierPros:- very quite- it works- smart control through the app- easy to operate- optional night lightCons:- OEM filters are expensive- the app is filled with other clutter and noise- can be tricky to create auto-programs for the deviceWould I recommend to others:  YesWould I purchase again:  Yes",
